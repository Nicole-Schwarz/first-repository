# My first day on GitHub. 
*Today I learned that control is an essential part of my career as web developer.*
Some keywords that I should remember for later are: 
- git
- GitHub
- version control
- commit
- hash.

The next 6 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
